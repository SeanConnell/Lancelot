warning: 
1, not recommend for icarus board. but you try if you can take the risks.
2, if the board running abnormal, please switch back to the 380M bitsteam.
3, if the board invalid rate is higher than 10%, please switch back to the 380M bitsteam.
4, not guarantee every Lancelot board can normally operation with this bitsteam. 
5, recommend you to use 42.bit for Interim test, it will lost if you turn off the board.

features:
1, fully auto speed regulation. about 460~520MH/s on Lancelot board.

how to update:
1, install XILINX Lab tooles (or ISE). i use V13.4. V14.2 may have some strange issues.
2, find and open "iMPACT" tool. press "cancel" if any dialog box popup.
3, connect the Platform Cable, power the board. the indicator light on the cable turn green.
4, click " Boundary Scan".  click "Initialize Chain". press "cancel" if any dialog box popup.
5, click "SPI/BPI ?" icon at the top of xc6slx150 device. and assign the MCS file. delect "SPI PROM", "W25Q64BV/CV", "1".
6, repeat step 5 for the other FPGA.
7, right click FLASH icon and select program.
8, wait for at least 8 min, than it will success.
9, turn off Icarus, and tun on. you will find the FLASH is already updated.
10, do  7~9 for the other FPGA.
11, finish.

Tips:
1, will significantly increase heat and power. about 23W pre board. so you need a power adaper can provide 12V@2A continuously.
2, cooling is very important. please DO NOT remove the original heat-sink and fan, they are enough for the top. use another fan blow from the side. the PCB it self is a heat-sink too.
3, not recommend for voltage adjustment.
4, a typical invalid rate is 5%. 
5, Job interval time can use about 6~7S for a better performance.
6, the speed measure is not accurate this time. please check the "shares pre hour" for a speed measures.
